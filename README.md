Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

Challenges
At first, I was confused about how to render a custom component in App.jsx, but I figured out that you just import it like a regular module and add the tag inside the return.
